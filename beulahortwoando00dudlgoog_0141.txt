before the Lord‚ toinquirc of His dealings with.
me, 1 was shown rnany lcssons3 He had given
me these assurances ho enable pne to hold on ho
the promises in faith for the blessing of relies, “
which was noh a small blessing. He was un-

doubtedly appointed ho die, and the Lord had .
sent him here for mapy reasons. One wasto

test me. Ι was not discouraged, for Iknew
that if our hord did not see fit ho raise him to
healhh in answer to such prayers as were offered
for him, nothing would save him. The post
mortem showed th ab no human skill could have

, reached his ease. His friends were all sahisfied.

Even in this trial, 1 could pr⁴aise the Lord. I
relr thar ‚the constant prayer had brought me
into a sceret place with the Lord which I had
noh known before.

ἵ The work is' eonshanhly going on for both
sonl and body. I am ableto resch many souls ·
that Ι could not approach were ir not for the

Gospel of Healing. Faith prayer mechings are
held ah Benlah‚ every Wednesdsy ah 2:30 P. Μ.
