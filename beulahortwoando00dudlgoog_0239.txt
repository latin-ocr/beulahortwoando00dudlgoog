Tesffloms. 235

“ There are many othere healed and con·
vested, whose testimonies Ihave been unable
to obtain‚'not knowing their present residenees,
Iregret to say that some who have felt the
Lord’s touch in both soul and body, have not
proven faithful. Ι still rejoiee that some have
gone rejoieing to theireternal home, saying

that their coming to “Beulah’' was the means
of their salvation.
