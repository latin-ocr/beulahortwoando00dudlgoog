use it ior His glory. “They shall speak with
new tongues.” This was one ol the most no-
tieeable giits given at Pentecost. I remember
hearing Mrs. M. Baxter, of England, relate an
incident of hei Christian labor bearing on this
point. She had a pressing invitation to speak
to a German audienae on Divina Healing. She

ι did not know the German language but felt · ι

that she could elairn this promise. She went
trusting the hord to give her the power to

. make them understand. When she arose to ’

speak‚ she uttered the sounds that earne into
her mind. One person was eonverted from the
evening's talk 'and the people were very sur·
·prised to learn that she knew nothing oi their

languaga yet had spoken to them. Other in· ·

stannes are on record similar to this. “'l'hey
' shall take up serpents, and if they drink any
deadly thing it shall not hurt them.'' We be-
lieve that (lod will show His¹ power in proteat·
ing His believing children. “They shall lay
hands on the siok and they shall reeover.''
