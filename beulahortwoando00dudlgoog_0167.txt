knew that =the-Lord would give me strength ⁵
to g03 and-He did, praise His holy name. I
gaye my soul and body, sinlsiek and sore to the
Lord and He healed me. 1 received the anoint·
ing by Mra. Griffin and after making a public
consecration of my entire being to the Lord (at
the saith prayer meeting held at “Romam the
same day) 1 requested united prayers for my
recovery. The dear Heavenly Father did hear
and answer our prayers just them for I was in·

. stantly relieved from all suffering. Α11 the ·

pain and stiffness caused from tho rheumatism3
⁴ all the itching and bummg caused from tho
leprousy was instantly taken away. My soul
was filled with praises and rejoieing to my lov-

home that night with the most perfect ease,

for 1 felt that the Lord was giving strength to
my body all the way.
